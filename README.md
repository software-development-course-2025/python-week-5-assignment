# 🐍 Python Week 5 Assignment – Object-Oriented Programming

## 📚 Overview

This repository contains two Python programs designed to explore key Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts:

- `superhero.py` — Demonstrates class creation, inheritance, encapsulation, and method overriding.
- `transport.py` — Illustrates polymorphism through different `Vehicle` subclasses each implementing `move()` uniquely.

---

##  Features

- Constructors using `__init__`
- Encapsulation via private attributes
- Class inheritance and method overriding
- Polymorphism in practice
- Clear, maintainable code with example usage

---

## ▶ Usage

Run each script independently:

```bash
python superhero.py
python transport.py  
```
