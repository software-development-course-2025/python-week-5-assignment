# Python Week 5 Assignment – Object-Oriented Programming

## 📚 Overview

This repository contains two Python programs designed to explore Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts such as:

- Class creation
- Inheritance
- Encapsulation
- Polymorphism

### Files included:

- `superhero.py` — Defines a `Superhero` class and a subclass `Mutant`, demonstrating constructors, attributes, methods, encapsulation, and inheritance.
- `transport.py` — Implements polymorphism with different `Vehicle` subclasses overriding a shared `move()` method.

---

## ⚙️ Features

- Class creation with constructors (`__init__`)
- Encapsulation using private attributes
- Inheritance and method overriding
- Polymorphism with common interface methods
- Sample usage demonstrating OOP concepts in action

## ▶️ Usage

Run each script independently from the terminal:

```bash
python superhero.py
python transport.py  
```
