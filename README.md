# Python Week 5 Assignment – Object-Oriented Programming

## Overview

This repository contains two Python programs designed to explore Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts such as classes, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.

- **superhero.py** — Defines a `Superhero` class and a subclass `Mutant` demonstrating constructors, attributes, methods, encapsulation, and inheritance.
- **transport.py** — Implements a polymorphism example with different `Vehicle` subclasses overriding a shared method `move()`.

## Features

- Class creation with constructors (`__init__`)
- Encapsulation using private attributes
- Inheritance and method overriding
- Polymorphism with common interface methods
- Sample usage demonstrating OOP concepts in action
