# 🐍 Python Week 5 Assignment – Object-Oriented Programming

## 📚 Overview

This repository contains two Python programs designed to explore key Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts.

##  Files Included

- `superhero.py` — Demonstrates constructors, inheritance, encapsulation, and method overriding via a `Mutant` subclass.
- `transport.py` — Polymorphism example: `Car`, `Plane`, and `Boat` override the shared method `move()` differently.

##  Features

- Constructors using `__init__`
- Encapsulation via private attributes
- Class inheritance and method overriding
- Polymorphism in practice
- Clear, maintainable code with example usage

## ▶ Usage

Run each script using your terminal:

```bash
python superhero.py
python transport.py  
```
